A common example of this is accessing a database located in a private subnet, as described in the VPC Scenario docs:
Instances in the private subnet are back-end servers that don&amp;rsquo;t need to accept incoming traffic from the internet and therefore do not have public IP addresses; however, they can send requests to the internet using the NAT gateway.</description></item><item><title>Concurrent Python Example Script</title><link>https://alukach.com/posts/concurrent-python-example-script/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 13:42:21 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alukach.com/posts/concurrent-python-example-script/</guid><description>Below is a very simple example of a script that I write and re-write more often than I would like to admit.

The basic idea of this post is to demonstrate how CloudFront can be utilized as a serverless reverse-proxy, allowing you to host all of your application&amp;rsquo;s content and services from a single domain. This minimizes a project&amp;rsquo;s TLD footprint while providing project organization and performance along the way.
Why Within large organizations, bureaucracy can make it a challenge to obtain a subdomain for a project.</description></item><item><title>How to generate a database URI from an AWS Secret</title><link>https://alukach.com/posts/database-uri-from-secret/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alukach.com/posts/database-uri-from-secret/</guid><description>A quick note about how to generate a database URI (or any other derived string) from an AWS SecretsManager SecretTargetAttachment (such as what&amp;rsquo;s provided via a RDS DatabaseInstance&amp;rsquo;s secret property).

It&amp;rsquo;s super cheap, it&amp;rsquo;s basically infinitely scalable, and it never goes down (except for when it does). Part of its beauty is its simplicity. You give it a file and a key to identify that file, you can have faith that it will store it without issue. You give it a key, you can have faith that it will return the file represented by that key, assuming there is one.</description></item><item><title>Boilerplate for S3 Batch Operation Lambda</title><link>https://alukach.com/posts/aws-s3-batch-operation-lambda-boilerplate/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alukach.com/posts/aws-s3-batch-operation-lambda-boilerplate/</guid><description>S3 Batch Operation provide a simple way to process a number of files stored in an S3 bucket with a Lambda function.

Its output is easily parsed by AWS Athena, enabling queries across the key names (e.g. find all keys ending with .png)
However, sometimes you just need to list all of the keys mentioned in the S3 Inventory output (e.g. populating an SQS queue with every keyname mentioned in an inventory output). The following code is an example of doing such task in Python:</description></item><item><title>A PIL-friendly class for S3 objects</title><link>https://alukach.com/posts/pil-friendly-s3-file/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alukach.com/posts/pil-friendly-s3-file/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick example of creating an file-like object in Python that represents an object on S3 and plays nicely with PIL.

Action with Intermediate Page Sometimes you may need an admin action that, when submitted, takes the user to a form where they provides some additional detail. The docs mention a bit about providing intermediate pages, but not a lot. It states:
Generally, something like [writing a intermediate page through the admin] isn’t considered a great idea. Most of the time, the best practice will be to return an HttpResponseRedirect and redirect the user to a view you’ve written, passing the list of selected objects in the GET query string.</description></item><item><title>Django Admin Fu, part 1</title><link>https://alukach.com/posts/django-admin-pt-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alukach.com/posts/django-admin-pt-1/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting some time into building out the Django Admin site for one of my company&amp;rsquo;s projects.

For those uninitiated, pushd changes your current directory in a similar fashion to cd but additionally adds the former directory to a stack. You can later return to the former directory by executing popd, popping it from the directory history. Unfortunately, the commands pushd and popd both require at least twice as many characters to type as cd and additionally come with the overhead of having to learnt o use a new command instead of something that is nearly instinctual.</description></item><item><title>SSH Port Forwarding</title><link>https://alukach.com/posts/ssh-port-forwarding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alukach.com/posts/ssh-port-forwarding/</guid><description>The other week I found myself up at 2am in Canada setting up a VPN between my home computer (running Ubuntu) in Seattle and my laptop &amp;lt;partyhard.jpg&amp;gt;.
